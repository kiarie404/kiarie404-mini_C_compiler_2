# kiarie404-mini_C_compiler_2
A mini-C compiler implemented using the sly library

This is a compiler project.
For the sake of simplicity, We will deal with two languages ... that doesn't make sense  haha ... anyway.

1. A small grammar
2. A medium grammar

The small grammar will be used as a template to learn how the medium grammar has been implemented. More like--- a programmer needs to understand an array, in order to understand a linked list
